# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 

## Problem Statement:

     Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
     measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
     their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
     measurements of the iris species and classify them.

# UNEMPLOYED ANALYSIS USING PYTHON 

## Problem Statement:

   Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
   who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
   increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
   can be a good data science project

# EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

## Problem Statement:

     In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
     train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get
     started.
     
     We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
     that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
     messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis using Python as part of the _data science internship_ at **Oasis Infobyte**. I explored various visualizations to understand the trends and patterns.
