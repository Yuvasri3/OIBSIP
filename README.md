# Unemployment Analysis using Python

This project analyzes the _unemployment scenario_ before and after the lockdown using Python. It includes data analysis, visualizations, 
and insights derived from the provided dataset.

## problem statement 

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project


## Features

- Analyze the unemployment rates, employment, and labor participation for different states and regions.
- Visualize the unemployment rates through various plots and charts.
- Compare the average unemployment rates before and after the lockdown.
- Explore the impact of lockdown on employment in different states.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is available in the DOWNLOAD DATASET FROM HERE https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india


## Code

- The `unemployment-analysis.ipynb` file contains the Jupyter Notebook code used for data analysis and visualization.
- The `app.py` file contains the Streamlit code for deploying the project as a web application.
- The `requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies required for running the Streamlit app.


## Project Structure
The project repository has the following structure:
- data.csv
- unemployment-analysis.ipynb
- README.md
Feel free to explore the repository and run the project locally.

## Additional Notes
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of unemployment rates using Python as part of the _data science internship_ at **Oasis Infobyte**. I explored various visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in unemployment data. The project includes descriptive statistics, heatmaps, box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and geographical plots to gain insights into the impact of lockdown on employment.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook file (_unemployment-analysis.ipynb_) for a detailed step-by-step analysis and visualization code.
